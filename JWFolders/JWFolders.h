@interface JWFolders : NSObject

/*
 Description:       The following are convenience methods that will create 
                    a JWFolders object which will handle the folder animation 
                    and removal for you.  All you are responsible for, as the 
                    sender, is to pass in (at minimum) the content view, position, 
                    and container view.  The rest are optional.
 
 ****Required Parameters****
 Content View:      This is the view that you wish to be embedded in between 
                    two folder-style panels.
 
 Container View:    This is the view in which you wish the folders to be added 
                    as a subview of. Behaviour when the container view is 
                    smaller than the content view is undefined.
 
 Position:          The position is used to determine where the folders should
                    be opened.  In later updates the x-coordinate will be used 
                    to create a "notch", similar to the iOS Springboard. The 
                    position should be relative to the container view.
 
 ****Optional Parameters****
 Sender:            The sender is currently not used, although in the future
                    it could be used for delegate callbacks, which have been
                    replaced by blocks in this version.
 
 Open Block:        The open block will be run when the animation of opening
                    the folder is about to be performed.  Use this opportunity
                    to perform animations and other custom behaviour on the
                    content view. Use the passed-in reference to the content view.
 
 Close Block:       The close block will be run when the animation of closing
                    the folder is about to be performed.  Use this opportunity
                    to perform animations and other custom behaviour on the
                    content view. Use the passed-in reference to the content veiw.
 
 Completion Block:  The completion block is called when the folder has been 
                    closed, and all views have been removed from the container
                    view.  Use this opportunity to perform updates in your UI
                    if needed.
